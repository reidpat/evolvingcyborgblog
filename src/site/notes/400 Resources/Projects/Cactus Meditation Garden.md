# Result
A gorgeous little space to sit in and meditate, complete with couch, lantern, and [[400 Resources/Projects/Slack line\|Slack line]]. I'm hoping to add gravel/sand to the area to allow good drainage for the cacti (the dirt here is something like baked clay - not very good as the top soil layer for cacti) as well as add some more cacti to the area. Maybe even rake the gravel into nice patterns like you would find in a rock garden.

# Process

Ithaka has some beautiful spaces in it. Unfortunately we also have a lot of trees which like to drop their leaves everywhere and make these spaces hard to use if someone isn't actively keeping them clear of leaves.

Oak leaves in particular are very sharp and pokey - not fun to exist in. 

There was one area at Ithaka that I noticed was covered in leaves, tarps, and some old chairs, but had this gorgeous cactus that must be at least 30 years old and 7' tall growing in it. I decided to clean, rake, and weed the area.

Area was completely filled with weeds and leaves. I ended up taking out over 6 full bins of compost.

Work in Progressâ€¦

Found a neat little shrine type thing that no one was using. So naturally I wired up an LED inside and turned it into a beautiful lantern.

Some strategic placement of rocks and statues turns it into a little shrine
