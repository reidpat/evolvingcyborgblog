Hi I'm Reid and I have stuff. I'm moving and need to get rid of all this stuff THIS WEEK! Please take my stuff. 
I have a broken collarbone, so I can't move anything myself. **PLS HELP**
I live at 5638 Birney Ave (in Wesbrook by UBC)
Text me at 778 888 7656 and let me know what you want and when you can come and get it (pick up only). 
If you take something you want/need, please also take something you don't want/need too.
