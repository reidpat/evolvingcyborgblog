What do you imagine when you think of the word "cyborg"? 

If you are like most people you probably have a vision of a human who has had parts of their body replaced by robotic components.

This view of cyborgs is common in popular media but it limits our understanding of the topic - it assumes that we must physically replace pieces of our body with pieces of a machine.  The word cyborg - short for *cybernetic organism* simply means a being which combines both biological and artificial elements, and if we ditch the requirement that the artificial element must be embedded within the flesh of the biological component, we may start to realize that **humans are cyborgs by our very nature**.

If someone where to surgically remove their biological eyeballs and replace them with a computerized system, we would no doubt have no issues with describing them as a cyborg. But how is this functionally different than reading the screen of your smartphone? In the case of surgically implanted eyeballs, the computer interfaces directly with this nerve, where with the smartphone it is first mediated by the lens and light receptors within the biological eyeball. In both cases information is being processed by an electronic system and being fed into our optic nerve. In both, we have used technology to augment our biological abilities. Both can be considered a cyborg.

Technology man more than just electronic circuitry and robotics. Humans have been using artificial technology to augment our physical abilities for millennia. We create clothes which allow us to survive in harsh environments, we use tools to plant and harvest crops to feed massive populations, we design glasses to help us see. 

One of our oldest technologies has been around long enough to affect the physical evolution of our bodies. Humans have one of the weakest digestive systems out of any animal, yet we have the widest variety of food sources available to us. How?

We use the technology of fire to cleanse our food of harmful bacteria so our stomach doesn't have to do it internally. We use knives to chop our food into small pieces so we don't need to spend as much time chewing. And because we have been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years its had time to influence our biological evolution. Without our technology, we are pitiful and weak compared to the rest of the animal kingdom - with it we are the most powerful beings. 

**As technology changes, we change with it**
