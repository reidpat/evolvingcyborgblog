#project #landscape #ithaka #activity
I've always wanted a slack line and wanted to put one up here at Ithaka. So I did.

## Progress snapshots:

Started by raking the leaves and moving the stumps

### V0
Tried securing one end to a group of stumps. Experimented with a few configurations of stump support structures. Couldn't get it secure enough to walk on though.

### V1
Tied it to a tree further away through some bushes. Not the best setup ever, but functional enough to walk on and it's out of the way so it should be able to stay in place semi-permanently. Counting this as a success for today. My shoulder hurts now 😥
Very happy that I got it up though!!!! 😁😁
