# Evolving Cyborg

An exploration of what it means to be a human-technology hybrid trying to live in the 21st century. Expect to find various philosophical musings, existential crises, and hope for a future in which we have navigated the technological minefield we have found ourselves within.

Also a blog for my travels. I suppose there isn't really a theme.

If you are arriving here for the first time, it would be helpful to start with [[400 Resources/Writing/What does it mean to be a cyborg❓\|What does it mean to be a cyborg❓]]
