What do you imagine when you think of the word "cyborg"? 

If you are like most people you probably have a vision of a human who has had parts of their body replaced by robotic components.

This view of cyborgs is common in popular media but it limits our understanding of the topic - it assumes that we must physically replace pieces of our body with pieces of a machine.  The word cyborg - short for *cybernetic organism* simply means a being which combines both biological and artificial elements, and if we ditch the requirement that the artificial element must be embedded within the flesh of the biological component, we may start to realize that **humans are cyborgs by our very nature**.

Let's take the example of artificial eye implants which display information about the world around us. If someone where to surgically remove their biological eyeballs and replace them with a computerized system, we would no doubt have no issues with describing them as a cyborg. But how is this functionally different than reading the screen of your smartphone? In both cases information is being processed by an electronic system and being fed into our optic nerve. In the case of surgically implanted eyeballs, the computer interfaces directly with this nerve, where with the smartphone it is first mediated by the lens and light receptors within the biological eyeball.
