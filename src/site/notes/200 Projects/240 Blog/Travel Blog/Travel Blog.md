It's been a while since I've had a travel blog, but I figured this would be a good time to start one up again. I recently moved from Vancouver to Palo Alto, and this is a good way for me to do some journaling and writing where I can share it with friends and family. 

*Don't expect this writing to be good.* It's just a way for me to get down some of my thoughts and feelings and share what I'm up to. It's going to be done as more of a stream of consciousness than something I think about and spend time editing.
