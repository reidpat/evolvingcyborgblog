So it's been a while since I last wrote or published any updates in this blog. The big reason for this is that I've been doing a complete overhaul of my Obsidian vault, which is the software I use to write and publish these notes. 

But I got things up and running on the new system, which I'm hoping will be much easier for me to use and publish with. The last one was getting rather messy after about 4 years of use, so it was time to clean house and do a big reorganization push. This will let me post more of my writing here, such as my book notes/summaries, my linked concepts map, and more of my writing. There's still a lot more work for me to do on this front, but at least the blog connection is working again ðŸ˜¸and I can start publishing things. 

Other life updates: 
- I'm [[400 Resources/Blog/Back on the EUC!\|Back on the EUC!]]
- Been spending a lot of time working on the Community Mycelium (post coming soon!)
