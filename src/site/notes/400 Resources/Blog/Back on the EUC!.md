After breaking my collarbone at the beginning of March, I'm officially back riding electric unicycles!

I started riding EUCs about a year ago now and it's quickly become a foundational part of my personality ðŸ˜…
Riding them makes you feel like you unlocked the superpower of flying; There's something special about the way you control it by leaning, hands free, watching the world rush by you. Very quickly the wheel starts to feel like it's a part of yourself rather than a thing that you are just riding. 

Here's a video of me riding through the Stanford Hills at sunset. Truly beautiful.
